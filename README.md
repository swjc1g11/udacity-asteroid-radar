# Getting started
To start the app, add the gradle.properties property marsApiKey, using an API key from the NASA near-earth objects API.

# What is this application?

I created this application as an end-of-module for the Android Kotlin Developer nanodegree programme. The module focused on using the the RecyclerView, networking, databases, offline caching, material design, accessibility and workers.

In this project, I implemented the following functionality using data-binding and more architechture components features:

- Downloading data from the NASA API using Retrofit and caching this offline in a local database
- A RecyclerView with a header using contemporary libraries and components
- Ensuring the app works with screen readers and is suitably set up for all kinds of users
- Following through with the MVVM pattern with fragments, view models and more
- Worked with the Picasso library
- Implementing custom data-binding adapters
- etc...

The app has a few known issues including the following:

- Not displaying the videos returned as image/media of the day from the API and rather only showing images

# Screenshots

Below are some screenshots from the project brief (the final app looks similar to these).
